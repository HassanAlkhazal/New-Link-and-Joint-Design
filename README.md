# New-Link-and-Joint-Design
The link is designed as a diamond shape to give the structure more angular rotation. It will help the structure to rotate at wider angle and rotate more efficient than the previous link. Also, it will consume less material during 3d printing. Moreover, the weight of the link is lower than the prior links, which will increase the efficiency of the robot.
